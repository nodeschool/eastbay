[MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) is the official GUI for MongoDB. With it you can perform CRUD operations and much more. Compass comes in a variety of editions. We will be using the 'community edition'. A comparison of the editions, currently four of them, can be found at: [Capabilities of Compass Editions](https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/master/#capabilities-of-compass-short-editions).

As with MongoDB itself, the best installation instructions are in the MongodDB documentation: [Download and Install Compass](https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/master/install/). Do be sure to select the 'community edition' as shown below.
