## There are no free domain names

I would define free as 1) not paying to register the domain name & 2) you are really the licensee of the domain name.

As far as I can tell, there are no free domain names. However, you can use a domain name for free by signing-up with [freenom](https://www.freenom.com) and get a completely usable domain name for [this book](https://klequis.io/full-stack-mern-development-series/).

> For this book, you can use any domain name you own or have the right to use. However, some small amount of the steps to follow will be specific to freenom so you may want to get one from there.
